# Contributing

There are lots of different ways that you can contribute to Orion:

- **Open issues**: Often we will have open issues that you can help out with, providing support or patches so they can be closed.

- **New features**: Perhaps Orion has a missing a killer feature, can you add it? Before you start working on it open a issue so we can discuss if the feature will be added to the project.

- **Documentation fixes**: Clarifications of parts you find confusing, inconsistencies with current behavior, spelling and grammar fixes, etc. Just edit the files in the docs folder.

- **Code commenting**: Do the comments contradict the code? Is there something in the code that confuses you? Once you figure it out, fix it and submit.

- **Testing**: Orion currently doesn't have test, we have plans to add the testing but time is short. This is the thing that is most needed in Orion.


### Rules

- **Always try to create a external package**: Orion is very extendible, in almost all cases you could create a package that connects with Orion, if you cant, try to create the apis in Orion that allows you to create a external package.

- **Add documentation**: You must add the documentation for the change/new feature you create. The documentation changes must come with the pull request.

- **Only Javascript**: We use the same language everywhere, be sure to use Javascript instead of Coffeescript or else.
